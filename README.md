## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository is a **living record of my problem-solving journey on Codeforces**.  
Each solution here represents not just a solved problem, but a step forward in improving:

- Logical thinking  
- Algorithmic intuition  
- Pattern recognition  
- Code efficiency and clarity  

The goal is **continuous improvement**, not shortcuts.
